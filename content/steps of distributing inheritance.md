The first priority is to *[[dhawu al-furud]]*. In this, the problem of *[['awl]]* may come up.

What is remaining goes to the *[['asba]]*. If there is no one from the 'asba to take the wealth then the remaining wealth (*[[radd]]*) is redistributed to *[[dhawu al-furud]]*. 

If the deceased has no *[[dhawu al-furud]]* nor *[['asba]]* then the wealth is distributed among *[[dhawu al-arham]]* - maternal relatives. 

If they have no relatives, the wealth goes to the *[[bayt al-mal]]*.

The system of distributing the inheritance is well summarized in the following practical guide: [[A Practical Guide to Islamic Law of Inheritance.pdf]]
