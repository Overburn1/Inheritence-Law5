This *bab* of *mu'amalat* has a variety of names: *fiqh al-[[mirath]], 'ilm al-fara'id, 'ilm al-mawarith*, etc. They all refer to the subject of inheritance: who does and does not inherit wealth from a given person and how much does each inheritor get? Or as technically articulated in Arabic:
	علم يعرف به من يرث ومن لا يرث ومقدار ما لكل وارث


# The Importance of fiqh al-mirath
It is a particularly important chapter of *fiqh* because its rules are explicitly stated in the Qur'an and because of a frightening hadith regarding it being the first knowledge to be forgotten:
عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: (تعلموا الفرائض وعلموها الناس فإنها نصف العلم وهو ينسى، وهو أول شيء ينزع من أمتي) رواه ابن ماجه والدارقطني

Also, it is one the special qualities of the companions mentioned in the hadith:

The subject, since the time of the Prophet ﷺ, has been referred to as *fara'id*, obligations - indicating its importance as an obligation.

لله ميراث السموات والأرض
- This wealth is a trust from Allah; we should strive to use it for His sake in our life and after our life.
